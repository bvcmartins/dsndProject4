For Seattle, January is very popular, probably due to winter birds escaping from Canada (like myself). We also see some high demand during the peak of summer. However, as happened with Boston, the data does not show mulitple years so we cannot draw any definite conclusions.\n",

    "The idea here is to use PCA to reduce dimensionality of the dataset and to aggregate original features into new variables, which are more meaningful for this problem. Then, using k-means clustering, we find how these features are aggregated in different classes. Last, we find to which classes most of the 4-star properties belong. Fear not! This is not as complicated as it sounds."
